# musrpy

Musrpy is a Python library for analysing ROOT histograms created by the muon simulation programs musrSim and musrSimAna. This package allows you to use custom detector groups, plot histograms contained in the ROOT tree and fit curves to this data.

See [musrpy.readthedocs.io](https://musrpy.readthedocs.io/) for documentation.
